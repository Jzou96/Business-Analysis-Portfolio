We give final recommendations about product portfolio according to short-term and long term profit.</p>

 <p>The wine retailer wants to know if email promotion is effective and who to target with the email campaign. Firstly, we use average causal effect analysis to evaluate email contribution to sales overall.

Finally, we use causal forest instead of uplift modeling to score customers and determind which segments should be target.</p>
